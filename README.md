# Expo CLI Compatibility and Package Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: incompatibility between the Node.js version, Expo SDK version, and project dependencies. This can manifest as various errors during the `expo start` or build process.

## Problem
The primary cause is often a mismatch between the required Node.js version specified by the Expo SDK and the version installed on your system.  Additionally, conflicting package versions or incorrect entries in `package.json` can lead to errors.

## Solution
1. **Verify Node.js Version:** Check the Expo SDK documentation to determine the compatible Node.js version range for your project. Use a version manager (like nvm or fnm) to switch to a compatible version. 
2. **Check `package.json`:** Carefully examine your `package.json` file for any dependency conflicts or incorrect script definitions.  Ensure that all dependencies are compatible with your chosen Expo SDK version.
3. **Clean and Reinstall Packages:** Run `npm cache clean --force` followed by `npm install` or `yarn install` to clear the npm cache and reinstall project dependencies. 
4. **Review Expo Logs:** Pay close attention to the error messages provided by the Expo CLI. They often provide clues about the root cause of the problem.
